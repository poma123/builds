# Maven Builds Server
This is the repository of the backend for my builds-page.
The page can be found here: https://poma123.github.io/builds/

This kinda serves as a "Continous Deployment" Service for Maven Projects,
but it utilises GitHub Pages.



## How it works
The code itself is basically just a basic node.js Program.<br>
It reads repositories from 'resources/repos.json' and connects to the GitHub-API.<br>
If you are interested in the specifics, then feel free to keep on reading.<br>

### 1. Commits
The first step is to retrieve the latest commit from [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/).<br>
It will compare that commit's timestamp to the locally stored repository.<br>
If the remote version is newer or if there isn't even a local version, we are calculating the new build id.<br>
After that it will proceed to step 2.<br>

### 2. Cloning
After we established that our repository is out of date, this program will ```git clone``` said repository.<br>
It will also locate it's pom.xml file and set the version to "DEV - $id (git $commit)".<br>

### 3. Compiling
This is the easiest step, the program just runs ```mvn clean package -B``` to compile our Maven Project.<br>
It will also catch the state (Success / Failure).<br>
If you enabled Sonar-Integration for this project, then it will also run a sonar-scan on the repository.<br>

### 4. Gathering Resources
Since the page can also display some additional information, the program will now fetch the project's license and tags.<br>
It will also relocate the compiled jar to our main project directory.<br>

### 5. Preparing the upload
Now the program will update our local builds.json file for the project.<br>
It will add the newly compiled build, set the latest and lastSuccessful version 
and it's going to tag any builds that match up with our previously fetched tags, with that tag.<br>
Then it will generate a fresh index.html page for the project (from "resources/template.html").<br>
And it will also generate a Status Badge (see "resources/badge.svg").<br>
If we specified a discord webhook, it will also post a message on your discord server.<br>

### 6. Finishing / Uploading
Now that everything completed, the program will add, commit and push all changed files to this repository.<br>
After it's done, it will clear out any source files that arised during ```git clone```.<br>
